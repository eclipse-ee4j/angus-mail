<body>
Tomcat is a complete web server written in Java that provides
support for the Servlet and JSP specifications.
Tomcat is developed as a part of the Apache
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta Project</a>.
Both binaries and source are available from the Jakarta web site.
<p>
To run the JakartaMailServlet, you must add the Jakarta Mail and JavaBeans
Activation Framework jar files to the <code>lib</code> directory
under the directory in which you installed Tomcat.  This will
cause Tomcat to include these jar files in its classpath automatically.
(Some packages of Tomcat version 4 include Jakarta Mail support.)
Depending on the version of Tomcat used, the <code>mail.jar</code>
and <code>activation.jar</code> files should be copied to the
<code>lib</code> directory or to an appropriate subdirectory of the
<code>lib</code> directory.
