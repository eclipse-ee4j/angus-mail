If you don't already have Apache web server and Apache JServ
module installed and running,
<br>you'll need to download them from the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache
Software Foundation</a>&nbsp; and install them. We
<br>were able to find binary versions of Apache web server for both the
Solaris and Windows NT
<br>operating systems, and Apache JServ 1.1.2 for Windows NT. However,
for Solaris,
<br>Apache JServ needed to be built from the source.
<p>(on Solaris)
<blockquote>Apache Web Server 1.3.9 (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/">binary</a>)
<br>Apache JServ 1.1.2 (built from <a href="http://java.apache.org/">source</a>)</blockquote>
(on NT)
<blockquote>Apache Web Server&nbsp; 1.3.14 (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/binaries/">binary</a>)
<br>Apache JServ 1.1.2 (<a href="http://java.apache.org/">binary</a>)</blockquote>
To run the JakartaMailServlet, you must add the Jakarta Mail and JavaBeans
Activation Framework
<br>jar files to the web server's system classpath. Apache JServ also requires
that the
<br>Java Servlet Development Kit&nbsp; 2.0 (<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/archive.html">JSDK2.0</a>)
is installed and also added to the web server's
<br>system classpath. JSDK2.0 is a reference implementation of the Servlet
API Specification Version 2.0.
<p>When running Apache JServ in automatic mode, add wrapper.classpath properties
for each
<br>of these jar files to the servlet engine's propeties file. The default
engine properties file is
<br>jserv.properties and is usually found in Apache JServ's 'conf' directory.
Wrapper properties
<br>are used to automatically start the servlet engine.
<p>(on Solaris)
<blockquote>wrapper.classpath=/files/java/lib/JSDK2.0/lib/jsdk.jar
<br>wrapper.classpath=/files/java/lib/jakartamail/jakarta.mail.jar
<br>wrapper.classpath=/files/java/lib/jaf/jakarta.activation.jar</blockquote>
(on NT)
<blockquote>wrapper.classpath=d:\java\lib\jsdk2.0\lib\jsdk.jar
<br>wrapper.classpath=d:\java\lib\jakartamail\jakarta.mail.jar
<br>wrapper.classpath=d:\java\lib\jaf\jakarta.activation.jar</blockquote>
When running Apache JServ in manual mode, add these jar files to the CLASSPATH
<br>environment variable (this is documented in the Jakarta Mail README file
and additional
<br>Windows NT information is provided <a href="classpath-NT.html">here</a>).
<p>Once this is done, restart the web server.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Additional Notes
<blockquote>One thing to watch out for is how the web server is referenced
when using the
<br>JakartaMailServlet on this web server.&nbsp; It is important to use the
configured server
<br>name (i.e. the name assigned with the ServerName directive) in the
URL. If the
<br>configured server name includes a domain, it must be referenced including
the
<br>domain, even if the JakartaMail.html page can be accessed without it.
<p>For example, Apache is configured with the ServerName set to 'shadygrove'.
If the Jakarta Mail demo is referenced by:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://shadygrove.east/example/JakartaMail.html
<p>and the initail reference to the JakartaMailServlet being:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://shadygrove.east/example/JakartaMailServlet
<p>the user is successfully logged in. However, when an attempt is made
to access the INBOX, the user is instructed to login because there is no
current session. When this occurs, note that the URL referencing the JakartaMailServlet
no longer contains the domain originally used but the configured ServerName.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://shadygrove/example/JakartaMailServlet
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Also note that Apache JServ does not use a SecurityManager or enforce
any Java
<br>security policy.</blockquote>
