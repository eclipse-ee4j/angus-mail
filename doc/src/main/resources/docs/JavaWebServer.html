<body>
If you don't already have Java Web Server installed and running,
you'll need to download it
<br>from the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/jwebserver/index.html">Java
Web Server</a>&nbsp; product page and install it. We tested the JakartaMailServlet
with
<br>these configurations.
<p>(on Solaris)
<blockquote>JavaWebServer 2.0 (binary)</blockquote>
(on NT)
<blockquote>JavaWebServer 2.0 (binary)</blockquote>
To run the JakartaMailServlet, you must add the Jakarta Mail and JavaBeans Activation
Framework
<br>jar files to the CLASSPATH environment variable (this is documented
in the Jakarta Mail README file
<br>and additional Windows NT information is provided <a href="classpath-NT.html">here</a>).
<p>Once this is done, restart the web server.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Additional Notes
<blockquote>If you run JavaWebServer 2.0 with the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) supplied with
<br>JavaWebServer, no additional security policy is necessary. The security
policy file
<br>(i.e. jserv.policy) supplied with the JRE contains the necessary permissions
for local servlets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you run JavaWebServer 2.0 with another JRE (with an installed
JDK for example), you
<br>must add the necessay security policy for running under a SecurityManager.</blockquote>
