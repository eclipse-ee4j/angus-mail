	README for the demo programs in this directory
	==============================================

These demo programs illustrate how to use the Jakarta Mail API to
perform a number of common email functions.  Note these these
programs are not intended to be examples of good user interfaces,
or good command line interfaces.  No one is expected to actually
*use* these programs for anything real.  Rather, their value is
in the source code.  Don't look at their command line arguments
or user interface to figure out what Jakarta Mail can do, look at
their source code.  We strongly recommend that you read the
source code and understand what these programs are doing before
running them.

All of these programs are simple command line tools with a UNIX
style interface.  On Windows you'll need to run them in an MS-DOS
window.  We apologize in advance for the inconsistency in how these
programs accept options.  There are generally two styles.  The very
simple style (e.g., as used by copier.java) requires a fixed number
of arguments in a fixed order.  Others (e.g., folderlist.java) take
UNIX-style options, many of which are optional, and which may appear
in any order.  The following notes should help you figure it out,
but if in doubt, read the source code.



- copier.java

	This program copies the specified messages from one folder to
	another. Both folders must belong to the same store.

  Usage:
	java copier <urlname> <src> <dest> <start> <end>

  Arguments (in order):

  <urlname>	: URL of the Store. The URL should include
		  the password as well (if needed).
		  Example: "imap://john:password@mailstore.com"

  <src>		: source folder
  <dest>	: destination folder
  <start>	: start message number
  <end>		: end message number


- folderlist.java

	This program lists information about the folders in a Store.

   Usage:
	java folderlist -L <url> -T <protocol> -H <host> -U <user> -P <passwd>
		   [-R <root>] [-r] [-v] [-D] <pattern>

   Options:

   -L <url>	: URL of the Store. The URL should include
		  the password as well (if needed).
		  Example: "imap://john:password@mailstore.com"
   -T <protocol> : store protocol (Ex: "imap")
   -H <host>	: hostname of store.
   -U <user>	: username (if needed)
   -P <passwd>	: password (if needed)

		  not present, listing starts from the default folder.
   -r		: list recursively - folder and all subfolders.
   -v		: verbose - show more info about each folder.
   -D		: Turn on session debugging
   <pattern>	: folders that match this pattern are listed. Use "*"
		  as wildcard to match everything.

   Arguments (in order):

   <to>		: Recipient address

- msgsend.java

	Send a simple text message. Optionally saves a copy
	of the outgoing message in a folder (record-folder).

	Most parameters to this program are optional. When
	the program is run, it interactively asks for
	the "To" and "Subject" fields if not already available.
	Then the program expects the body of the message.
	After you type in the body, hit Ctrl-D on Unix
	systems or Ctrl-Z on Windows systems to send
	the message.

   Usage:
	java msgsend -L <store-url> -T <protocol> -H <host> -U <user>
		-P <passwd> -s <subject> -o <from> -c <cc> -b <bcc>

   Options:

   -L <store-url> : URL of the store for the record-folder
   -T <protocol> : If <store-url> is not present, this indicates
		  the store protocol for the record-folder.
   -H <host>	: If <store-url> is not present, this indicates
		  the hostname for the record-folder.
   -U <user>	: If <store-url> is not present, this indicates
		  the username for the record-folder.
   -P <passwd>	: If <store-url> is not present, this indicates
		  the password for the record-folder.
   -f <record>	: name of record-folder.
   -M <smtphost> : Host name of SMTP server.  Defaults to "localhost"
		  which often works on UNIX but rarely on Windows.

   -o <from>	: From address of message to be sent
   -c <cc>	: Cc address of message to be sent
   -b <bcc>	: Bcc address of message to be sent
