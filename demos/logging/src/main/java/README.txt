Logging Demo
------------

Notes:
======

This should not be taken as a demo of how to use the logging API, but
rather how to use the features of the MailHandler.

To run the demo:
================

    1.  The demo requires Java version 1.5 or newer.
	We *strongly* encourage you to use the latest version of J2SE,
	which you can download from
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads.

    2.  Set your CLASSPATH to include the "mail.jar" and "activation.jar".

	For JDK 1.1 on UNIX:

	export CLASSPATH=/u/me/download/mail.jar:/u/me/download/activation.jar.

	For JDK 1.2 and newer on UNIX:

	export CLASSPATH=/u/me/download/mail.jar:/u/me/download/activation.jar:.

    3.  Go to the demo/logging directory

    4.  Compile all the files using your Java compiler.  For example:

	  javac *.java

    5.  Not required but, you should edit the maildemo.properties and change the
        mail.to address and mail.host to your mail server ip or host name.

    6.  Run the demo. For example:

	  java -Dmail.debug=false -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/u/me/download/jakartamail/demo/maildemo.properties MailHandlerDemo



Overview of the Classes
=======================

Main Classes:

	MailHandlerDemo       = The main method creates log messages
				for the MailHander to capture.  The
				initXXX methods describe some of the
				common setup code for different types
				of email messages.

                       Usage: java MailHandlerDemo [[-all] | [-body] | [-debug]
                                | [-low] | [-simple] | [-pushlevel]
                                | [-pushfilter] | [-pushnormal]| [-pushonly]]

                        Options:
                            -all    : Execute all demos.
                            -body   : An email with all records and only a body.
                            -custom : An email with attachments and dynamic names.
                            -debug  : Output basic debug information about the
                                        JVM and log configuration.
                            -low    : Generates multiple emails due to low
                                        capacity.
                            -simple : An email with all records with body and an
                                        attachment.
                            -pushlevel	: Generates high priority emails when
                                            the push level is triggered and
                                            normal priority when flushed.
                            -pushFilter	: Generates high priority emails when
                                            the push level and the push filter
                                            is triggered and normal priority
                                            emails when flushed.
                            -pushnormal	: Generates multiple emails when the
                                            MemoryHandler push level is
                                            triggered.  All generated email are
                                            sent as normal priority.
                            -pushonly	: Generates multiple emails when the
                                            MemoryHandler push level is
                                            triggered.  Generates high priority
                                            emails when the push level is
                                            triggered and normal priority when
                                            flushed.


	FileErrorManager      = Used to store email messages to the
				local file system when mail transport
				fails.  This is installed as a
				fallback in case the logging config is
				not specified.

	SummaryFormatter      = An example compact formatter with summary
                                for use with the body of an email message.

Support files:

	maildemo.properties   = A sample LogManager properties file for
				the MailHandlerDemo.

	maildemo.policy       = A sample security policy file to use with
                                the MailHandlerDemo.  This can be used to
                                enable security tracing.
