/**
 * From RFC2060:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *
 * 5.1.3.  Mailbox International Naming Convention
 *
 *   By convention, international mailbox names are specified using a
 *   modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [UTF-7].  The
 *   purpose of these modifications is to correct the following problems
 *   with UTF-7:
 *
 *      1) UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with
 *         the common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET
 *         newsgroup names.
 *
 *      2) UTF-7's encoding is BASE64 which uses the "/" character; this
 *         conflicts with the use of "/" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.
 *
 *      3) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "\"; this conflicts with
 *         the use of "\" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.
 *
 *      4) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "~"; this conflicts with
 *         the use of "~" in some servers as a home directory indicator.
 *
 *      5) UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
 *         string; in particular, printable US-ASCII chararacters can be
 *         represented in encoded form.
 *
 *   In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters except for "&amp;"
 *   represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
 *   and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&amp;" (0x26) is represented by the two-
 *   octet sequence "&amp;-".
 *
 *   All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f, 0x7f-0xff, and all
 *   Unicode 16-bit octets) are represented in modified BASE64, with a
 *   further modification from [UTF-7] that "," is used instead of "/".
 *   Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be used to represent any printing US-ASCII
 *   character which can represent itself.
 *
 *   "&amp;" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to US-
 *   ASCII.  All names start in US-ASCII, and MUST end in US-ASCII (that
 *   is, a name that ends with a Unicode 16-bit octet MUST end with a "-
 *   ").
 *
 *   For example, here is a mailbox name which mixes English, Japanese,
 *   and Chinese text: ~peter/mail/&amp;ZeVnLIqe-/&amp;U,BTFw-
 *
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * This class will do the correct Encoding for the IMAP mailboxes.
