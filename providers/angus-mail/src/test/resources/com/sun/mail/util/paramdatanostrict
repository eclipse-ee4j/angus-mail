Comment:

        A set of test headers to test parameter list parsing
	with mail.mime.parameters.strict=false.
        Use with:
	java -Dmail.mime.parameters.strict=false paramtest -p <paramdatanostrict

        CAREFUL: a blank line in this file causes everything following it
                 to be ignored until a line starting with "From " (so that
                 paramtest -p can be pointed at a real mailbox).

From start here
