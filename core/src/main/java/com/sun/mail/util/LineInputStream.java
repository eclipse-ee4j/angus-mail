/**
 * LineInputStream supports reading CRLF terminated lines that

 * functionality that is similar to the deprecated 
 * <code>DataInputStream.readLine()</code>. Expected use is to read
 * lines as String objects from an IMAP/SMTP/etc. stream. <p>
 *
 * This class also supports UTF-8 data by calling the appropriate
 * constructor.  Or, if the System property <code>mail.mime.allowutf8</code>
 * is set to true, an attempt will be made to interpret the data as UTF-8,
 * falling back to treating it as an 8-bit charset if that fails. <p>
 *
 * LineInputStream is implemented as a FilterInputStream, so one can just
 * wrap it around any input stream and read bytes from this filter.
